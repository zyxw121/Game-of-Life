A highly customizable, concurrent, cellular automaton simulator

### Usage
First, compile the program by executing the script. Compiled files are put into the `BUILD` directory.

```

To run the program you'll need a RLE pattern file. To simulate the pattern in `pattern` for `n` generations execute the script `Life`.

```
./Life pattern n
```
